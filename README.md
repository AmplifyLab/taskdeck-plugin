# TaskDeck for Claude Code

`/taskdeck:track` puts your work on a [TaskDeck](https://taskdeck.me) board. Run it once in a repository or a workspace and every task Claude does there becomes a card, with the reasons, the criteria and the verification on it.

## What is what

| Piece | What it is | What it is for |
|---|---|---|
| **TaskDeck MCP server** | The connection between Claude Code and your TaskDeck account: a `taskdeck` entry in `~/.claude.json` | Gives Claude Code the TaskDeck tools (boards, cards, Autotrack) in the terminal, the desktop app's Code tab and IDEs, with a Claude account or an API key |
| **TaskDeck plugin** (this repository) | A Claude Code add-on | Adds `/taskdeck:track`, the setup command. It adds the TaskDeck server first if it is missing |
| **`/taskdeck:track`** | The setup, run once per folder | Picks or creates the board, turns Autotrack on and writes a short block into the folder's CLAUDE.md |

## Quick start

1. Install the plugin:

   ```bash
   claude plugin marketplace add AmplifyLab/taskdeck-plugin
   claude plugin install taskdeck@taskdeck
   ```

2. In the folder you want tracked, run:

   ```
   /taskdeck:track
   ```

   If TaskDeck is not connected yet, it adds the TaskDeck server to `~/.claude.json` and asks you to open a new session, sign in with `/mcp` and run `/taskdeck:track` again. The setup then asks at most a few questions: which board, how it should look, when finished cards leave it, and whose name Claude's work carries.

`/taskdeck:track Web` tracks the folder on an existing board called Web without asking which.

No terminal, only the desktop app? Copy the setup prompt from the Connections page in TaskDeck and paste it into the Code tab. It needs no plugin.

## Manual install

Do the same steps by hand to see what each one does:

1. **Connect TaskDeck.** Add this under `"mcpServers"` in `~/.claude.json`:

   ```json
   "taskdeck": { "type": "http", "url": "https://mcp.taskdeck.me/mcp" }
   ```

   In the terminal, `claude mcp add --transport http --scope user taskdeck https://mcp.taskdeck.me/mcp` does the same. Open a new session and run `/mcp` to sign in to TaskDeck.
2. **Install the plugin** with the two commands above. `/taskdeck:track` appears in Claude Code.
3. **Run `/taskdeck:track`** in the folder.

In Claude's Chat tab, on the web and on mobile, TaskDeck is a connector instead: Customize → Connectors → Add custom connector, with the same URL.

## After setup

Ask Claude for work the way you always do. It calls `start-work` before changing anything, comments on the card as it goes, and calls `finish-work` when the work is verified.
